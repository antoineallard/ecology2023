### Notebooks

_Out of the box_ use of the [notebooks](notebooks/) require to download the example dataset [`Data_Jeu_Pred-Prey_IAOMay2022.zip`](https://usherbrooke-my.sharepoint.com/personal/teig3501_usherbrooke_ca/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?ga=1&id=%2Fpersonal%2Fteig3501%5Fusherbrooke%5Fca%2FDocuments%2FSS23%2DDATA%2Fwp1%2Dcomplex%5Fnetworks) and to uncompress its content into [data/2022_05/Data_Jeu_Pred-Prey_IAOMay2022/](data/2022_05/Data_Jeu_Pred-Prey_IAOMay2022/).


### Slides

Antoine Allard's slides can be downloaded [here](slides/complex_networks.pdf).


### Steps length/orientation data

Steps length and orientation can be downloaded [here](data/2022_05/steps_original_positions.csv) for the original positions (i.e. irregular time intervals), and [here](data/2022_05/steps_interpolated_positions.csv) for the interpolated positions (i.e. positions at every seconds).
